# Defender of the Earth

## Project 1 | The Game | JS - CSS - HTML

### Description:

A top down space shooter game.

You control a spaceship to destroy the asteroids. And in the finale you'll meet the Alien Invasion. 
Who is apparently not well-disposed towards you.

### MVP

The minimum was destroying the asteroids. And the collection of points. 
You die when you collide with an asteroid.

### Backlog

1. a Healthbar - You lose life when you hit an asteroid
